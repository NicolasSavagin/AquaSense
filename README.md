# Aquarium Management System

The **Aquarium Management System** is a web-based application designed for aquarium enthusiasts and hobbyists who want to efficiently manage and monitor their aquariums. This tool helps track essential water parameters, particularly pH levels, and provides compatibility checks between different fish and plant species to ensure a healthy environment.

## Features

- **Aquarium Creation**: Easily create and name multiple aquariums to organize your collection.
- **Species Database**: Choose from a preloaded database of fish and plant species, each with detailed information on ideal pH, descriptions, and behavior.
- **Real-time pH Monitoring**: Display the current pH level for each aquarium and receive IoT notifications if it deviates from the ideal range.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Check compatibility between different species, with warnings displayed for incompatible combinations.
- **Interactive Modals**: View species details and images in a responsive modal window, enhancing user experience.
- **Editable Quantity**: Adjust the number of each species in your aquarium to reflect real-world changes.
- **Clean & Intuitive UI**: User-friendly design for efficient aquarium management and real-time data visualization.

## Getting Started

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NicolasSavagin/AquaSense
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Make sure you have a `species.json` file with your species data in the root directory to ensure proper functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For front-end design and interactivity.
- **IoT Integration**: Optional setup for real-time notifications on pH levels (requires additional hardware and configuration).
- **JSON**: Used for managing the species database.

## Future Enhancements

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Add support for monitoring and controlling water temperature.
- **Advanced Compatibility Rules**: Implement more complex compatibility rules based on behavior and tank size.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to save and access their aquarium settings from different devices.
